# Versioning Checker

Simple JavaScript GitHub Action for checking if the `CHANGELOG.md` and `APP_VERSION` files (in the repos base) have been updated when a PR is opened/run.

## Getting started

The first step, as always, is to clone the repo to your machine. Run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mwcodebase/BLOB
